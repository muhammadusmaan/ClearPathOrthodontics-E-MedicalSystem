# ClearPath Orthodontics-E-Medical System

The ClearPath Orthodontics E-Medical System, developed by Muhammad Usman and Saad Aslam as part of their Bachelors in Computer Science program, is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and digitize the medical processes within an orthodontics organization. The project, conducted under the supervision of Dr. Asad Raza Kazmi, aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of tasks related to patient data management, case processing, and overall workflow.

**Working of the System:**

The system follows a structured methodology, employing a Waterfall Model for development. It encompasses various features, starting with the capability to provide and receive patient data, initiate case entries, and prioritize cases. Through functionalities like the Picklist and Case Approval, the system ensures a systematic and organized approach to case management. Additionally, it incorporates elements such as Case Timeline, Quality Checking, and Progress Reports to monitor and maintain the quality and progress of each case.

The non-functional requirements, including user-friendliness, data integrity, authorization, and confidentiality, contribute to a secure and user-centric experience. The system also focuses on performance, reliability, flexibility, and supportability to meet the diverse needs of orthodontic professionals.

To facilitate understanding, the project includes various diagrams such as Use Case, Activity, Class, Collaboration, Sequence, and Data Flow Diagrams. These visual representations offer insights into the system's structure and interactions. The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) provides a clear depiction of the database structure.

In the implementation stage, the system undergoes development in PHP Laravel, with a backend SQL database. The user interfaces cater to different roles, including doctors, administrators, quality checkers, and clients. Extensive testing, outlined in Test Cases, ensures the reliability and functionality of the web application.

In conclusion, the ClearPath Orthodontics E-Medical System is a robust solution that modernizes and optimizes orthodontic processes, offering a user-friendly interface and comprehensive functionalities to improve overall efficiency in a medical practice. Future work may involve further enhancements and the integration of additional features to meet evolving industry needs.
